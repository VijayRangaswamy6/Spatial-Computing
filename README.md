## 🔍 What is Spatial Computing?

Spatial computing refers to the ability of computers and devices to **map, understand, and interact** with the 3D environment around them. It includes technologies like:
- **Lidar & Photogrammetry** for 3D scanning
- **Machine vision** and **AI** for real-time analysis
- **AR/VR/MR** for immersive experiences
- **Motion sensors & speech recognition** for intuitive interaction

## ⚙️ How It Works: Key Steps

1. **Data Collection**  
   Techniques like LiDAR, radar, and photogrammetry generate 3D spatial data through scanning and imagery.

2. **Data Analysis**  
   Machine vision and AI identify objects, track motion, and understand interactions in the environment.

3. **User Interaction**  
   Spatial systems respond in real time using motion sensors, hand gestures, and voice commands.
